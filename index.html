    <h1>Self Introduction – Dinesh</h1>

    <p>
        My name is <strong>Dinesh</strong>, and I am currently pursuing my <strong>first year in Cybersecurity</strong>. 
        From a young age, I have always been curious about how computers work, how websites operate, and how digital information 
        travels across the internet. This curiosity naturally pushed me towards the field of cybersecurity, where I can learn not 
        only how systems function, but also how to protect them from threats. I strongly believe that in today’s world, where most 
        activities happen online, cybersecurity professionals play a very important role, and I am excited to be progressing in this field.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a first-year student, I am building my foundation by learning subjects like <strong>networking basics, operating systems, 
        programming fundamentals, Linux, and security principles</strong>. I enjoy exploring how attacks happen and how we can prevent 
        them using defensive tools. Ethical hacking, penetration testing, and digital forensics are topics that inspire me, and I hope 
        to develop strong skills in these areas as I move forward. I also try to stay updated by watching cybersecurity tutorials, reading 
        articles, and learning about real-world cyber attacks, because this field keeps evolving every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a <strong>curious learner</strong> who likes solving problems step by step. When I face a technical issue, I enjoy experimenting, 
        researching, and finding a solution on my own. This habit helps me improve my knowledge and increases my confidence. I believe 
        that cybersecurity requires patience, logical thinking, and continuous learning, and I am working every day to develop these qualities. 
        I also enjoy doing hands-on practice using virtual labs, Linux commands, and basic tools used by cybersecurity beginners.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from academics, I value teamwork and communication. Cybersecurity is not only about technical skills but also about 
        working with others, analyzing situations, and taking responsible decisions. I try to maintain a positive attitude, help my 
        classmates, and learn from them as well. In my free time, I like watching tech videos, reading security blogs, and exploring 
        new tools that can strengthen my understanding of the field.
    </p>

    <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a <strong>skilled cybersecurity professional</strong>, specializing in areas like ethical hacking, 
        penetration testing, or incident response. I want to build strong technical knowledge and contribute to making digital systems 
        safer. As a beginner, I know I have a long journey ahead, but I am committed, motivated, and ready to work hard to reach my goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, I am excited about my cybersecurity journey, eager to learn new things, and looking forward to growing into a confident 
        and capable security professional.
